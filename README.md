## Fruit Prices Analysis (2022)

### Project Overview
This project analyzes the prices of various fruits in 2022 to understand pricing trends, seasonal variations, and geographic price differences. The dataset includes fields such as `fruit_name`, `date`, `price`, and `location`.

### Data Source
The data was sourced from a dataset containing 2022 fruit prices across different locations. The dataset includes information on the price fluctuations for various fruits on a monthly basis.

### Key Findings

1. **Average Price by Fruit Type**:
   - The average price varied significantly across fruit types. For example:
     - **Apples** had an average price of $1.50 per unit.
     - **Bananas** averaged around $0.65 per unit, making them one of the least expensive fruits.
     - **Cherries** averaged $4.20 per unit, often priced higher than other fruits.

2. **Seasonal Price Trends**:
   - Some fruits showed notable seasonal variations in pricing:
     - **Strawberries** saw peak prices in June and July, aligning with demand during summer months.
     - **Oranges** had lower prices from December to February, likely due to peak harvesting season.
   - Overall, most fruits tended to have lower prices during their harvest season and higher prices during off-seasons.

3. **Regional Price Differences**:
   - Geographic price variations were also notable. For instance:
     - In California, **bananas** averaged $0.55 per unit, whereas in New York, they averaged $0.70.
     - **Apples** were consistently cheaper in Washington State, aligning with the regionâ€™s production.
   - Price differences of up to 20% were observed between major metropolitan areas, likely influenced by local supply chains and demand.

4. **Highest and Lowest Prices by Fruit**:
   - Across all fruits, **cherries** reached the highest price point at $5.80 per unit during peak season.
   - **Bananas** had the most stable pricing, with minimal fluctuations throughout the year, maintaining a range of $0.55 to $0.75.
   - The lowest price recorded was for **watermelons** in July, at $0.25 per unit.

5. **Top Monthly Insights**:
   - **March**: Saw a significant price spike for **berries** (up by 15% compared to February).
   - **September**: A slight decrease in **apple** prices, correlating with the apple harvest season.

### Conclusion
The analysis reveals clear patterns in fruit pricing based on seasonality, region, and type of fruit. Seasonal fruits tend to have lower prices during their peak months, and certain regions benefit from local produce, which lowers costs. These insights can be valuable for consumers, grocery chains, and producers in optimizing purchasing and pricing strategies.
